# Profile Picture Setup

To add your profile picture:

1. Place your profile picture file named `Haris.png` in the `public` folder
2. The image should be a square (recommended: 500x500px or higher)
3. The image will automatically be displayed in the hero section with a glowing border

**Current path needed:** `public/Haris.png`

If the image is not found, the site will automatically fall back to showing your initials "MH" with a gradient background.
